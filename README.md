# Task 03: Customer Purchase Prediction using a Decision Tree Classifier

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and behavioral data. Using the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, I implemented a Decision Tree classifier, focusing on the entire model lifecycle from data preprocessing to evaluation.

# Project Pipeline:
Data Preprocessing: Handled categorical variables (e.g., job, marital, education) using one-hot encoding and label encoding. Scaled numerical features for optimal performance.

Model Training: Implemented a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn, experimenting with hyperparameters like max_depth and criterion to prevent overfitting.

Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix. Achieved a clear understanding of the trade-off between correctly identifying potential customers (recall) and minimizing false positives (precision).

Feature Importance: Analyzed the decision tree to identify the most influential features in predicting subscription, such as duration, contact, and month.

This project demonstrates a practical application of a fundamental ML algorithm to solve a real-world business problem in marketing.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
